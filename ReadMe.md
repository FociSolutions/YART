**Y**et **A**nother **R**XJS **T**utorial

There are many tutorials in RXJS on the web, this ones mine.

## Prerequistes

- Some experience with _Typescript_ or _Javascript_ is handy.
- The examples were all written in VSCode on a docker dev container, so maximum milage can be obtained with that configuration.
