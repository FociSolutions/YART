# Getting Started

Let's be honest, we're here because we're doing an _Angular_ project and we need to wire up some services.  

Start by setting up the basic _Angular_ tooling.

```sh
npm install --global @angular/cli
```

I'm a great advocate of spelling things out in full on the command line, two reasons:

1. I can usually remember the action because it's fully spelled out, and
1. my keyboarding is clumsy at times and it's easier to miss-spell `npm i -g @angular/cli`
